This is a small Card 24 game. It presents you with four randomly selected cards, with ace being 1, jack being 11, queen being 12, and king being 13. You must enter a arithmetic expression using all the values presented, to evaluate to 24 total. You can use +, -, *, /, and (). There is a button to verify and another button to refresh the cards selected and try again. If your value is not correct you will get a pop-up giving the wrong value and allowing you to try again.
